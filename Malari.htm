<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Malaria is a widely known human disease. It
is caused by infection with a pathogenic protozoan parasite of blood, the
Plasmodium. Malaria is one of the most common diseases of mankind. It is more
common in tropical and subtropical countries, especially in Africa and Asia,
where millions are infected. It is responsible for the death and reduced
resistance in large number of persons every year, the heaviest toll being the
children under 4 years of age.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Due to WHO and NMEP (National Malaria
Eradication Programme) of India, the malaria was effectively reduced but party
owing to socio-economic factors and partly because of unexpected proliferation
of DDT- resistant mosquitoes and drug-resistant parasites, the attempts to
eradicate the infection have failed and the malaria is again on increase. About
60 species of Plasmodium are known to cause malaria in reptiles, birds and
mammals. According to Jahn, there are 4 species in man, 4 in monkeys, 15 in
birds, 13 in reptiles, and one or more in buffalo, antelope, squirrels, bats
and frogs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Malarial parasites are found widely spread
from 45°S to 63° N latitudes. Their endemic home is in the tropical zone, but
they also occur in many temperate countries. Species infecting the migratory
birds are spread all over the world. Some avian malarial parasites are confined
to cold regions only. Species infecting reptiles have a localized distribution.</span></p>
